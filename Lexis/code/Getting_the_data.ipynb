      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that on Jan. 21, 2004, Alexandra M. Lisowski of Passaic, N.J., was driving over a New Jersey Transit railroad crossing at Midland Avenue in Elmwood Park, N.J., when she heard a train approaching from the north. Realizing that she might not have enough time to cross, Lisowski backed up her car, but instead of backing over the crossing like she came, Lisowski backed into a trench at the end of the tracks and the car got stuck, sources said. Sources said Lisowski exited the car just as it was hit by the train, which also clipped her.Lisowski suffered a compression fracture at T-12 in her lower back, sources said, and had surgery to fuse five vertebrae together with a steel rod. Sources said Lisowski, now 33, has physical restrictions on bending and twisting her body.Lisowski sued New Jersey Transit on Nov. 3, 2004, in the Bergen County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: The Borough of Elmwood Park, N.J., was initially named in the complaint, sources said, but was dismissed before trial.Sources said the trial lasted six days and the jury deliberated two hours.New Jersey Transit was found to be 51 percent negligent because the train was going too fast and broke too late to avoid hitting Lisowski's car, sources said. Lisowski was found 49 percent negligent because the jury said she should have waited for the cars in front of her to pass over the tracks before proceeding and because she would have backed up in a straight line, sources said. Sources said that as a result, the jury award was reduced to $765,000.Sources said New Jersey Transit made no offer of settlement before the trial and rejected a nonbinding arbitration award of $150,000.\n",

Sources said the data recorder in the bus indicated that it was traveling at 41.5 mph in a 50 mph zone, with no evidence of braking to avoid hitting the Farro's car.Both Farros suffered closed head injuries and remember nothing of the accident, sources said.Sources said Andrea Farro also suffered a fractured pelvic bone, ulna and two ribs. She underwent cervical spine surgery to insert a metal rod to stabilize her spine and was able to return to her job in insurance sales in six months, sources said. Farro sued New Jersey Transit and her insurer, Allstate Insurance Co., which denied her defense and indemnity, on Feb. 24, 2004, in the Salem County Superior Court.\n",

The force of the impact caused Scott to hit Harriatt. Harriatt, sources said, suffered a back injury, including a bulging disc and lumbar sprain, and he sued Scott and Wilson in the Union County, N.J., Superior Court on Sept. 19, 2003.\n",

      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that on March 26, 2003, Megan Keir was a 15-year-old freshman at Winslow Township High School and a member of the girls lacrosse team. On that day the varsity and junior varsity teams learned of a scrimmage that had been scheduled for that afternoon, sources said. Sources said Keir was a passenger in the back seat of a car that was involved in a broad-side collision while involved in an attempt to rush home and retrieve uniforms, with another car, which ran a stop sign.The scrimmage had been scheduled the day before, sources said, but the coaches failed to notify the players until shortly before the end-of-day dismissal when it was announced over the school public address system. Sources said the car Keir was riding in had to make five stops in 20 minutes and the driver had a conditional driver's license, which meant she was not allowed to have the four other teenage passengers in the car.Sources said the coaches conceded that the mix-up occurred but claimed that they did not tell the players to leave and get their uniforms or that they had left school premises.Sources said Keir's location in the car took the brunt of the force of the accident and she suffered multiple fractures and facial scarring, which required several surgeries.Brian Keir, on behalf of his daughter Megan sued the high school and the Winslow Township Board of Education, which sets school policy, on April 7, 2004, in the Camden County Superior Court.\n",

While walking along this road, she was struck by a car driven by a drunken driver.The source said that Holcomb Bus Service is a private contractor for New Jersey public school bus transportation. The source noted that Burkert said she was told to exit the bus three-tenths of a mile from her home and walk down a high-speed, rural road with no sidewalks instead of getting dropped her off at the designated stop in front of her home. The Holcomb Bus Service driver allegedly did this more than 40 times the year before the accident occurred because it shortened the bus route.\n",

      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that on a snowy, icy March 6, 2003, Elaine Fernandes was waiting to make a left turn from Polifly Road in Hackensack, N.J., onto Marvin Avenue. Waiting directly behind Fernandes, sources said, was a Power Electric Inc. van driven by Israel Cruz, and directly behind Cruz was a Mechanical Preservation Associates van driven by Gary Truelove. As Fernandes waited to make the turn, she was struck from behind and then on the driver's side door, sources said. Sources said Fernandes claimed that Truelove hit Cruz's van, pushing it into Fernandes' car, and then Cruz swerved into oncoming traffic and hit Fernandes' driver's side door.Sources said Fernandes hit her head and tore the meniscus ligament in her knee, which required arthroscopic surgery. Fernandes also injured her back and neck, including a herniation at L4-5, sources said. Sources said Fernandes had a laminectomy, radical diskectomy and forminatomy procedures in the L3 to S1 regions of her spine. Fernandes also had a spinal leak patched and a cyst removed, sources said. As a result of the accident, sources said, Fernandes has sciatic pain down her back and some days must use a cane to walk.Fernandes sued Truelove, Cruz, Power Electric and Mechanical Preservation Associates in April 2004 in the Bergen County Superior Court.\n",

They struck a car going north and driven by Charles Morris and were killed, sources said. Sources said Rivera died about 20 minutes later, and Rodriguez died a few hours later in the hospital.Sources said Rodriguez's blood-alcohol level was .24 percent, well ahead of the legal limit at the time, which was .10 percent. The legal limit in New Jersey is now .08 percent.The estates of Rivera and Rodriguez sued Oak Tavern on April 7, 2004, in the Cumberland County Superior Court.\n",

      "Other: The trial lasted seven days, and the jury deliberated three hours, sources said.Sources said the driver of the vehicle struck by Rodriguez's car, Morris, was dismissed from the case on summary judgment, as was the first bar Rodriguez and Rivera went to, Randazzo's Tavern in Vineland.The jury found that Rodriguez did not exhibit signs of intoxication during the little more than an hour the pair was in the bar, sources said. This claim was backed up by a witness who was with the pair, sources said.Sources said the jury assessed $558,000 in damages against Rodriguez's estate, payable to Rivera's estate, but reduced the award to $418,400 after finding Rivera 25 percent negligent. Rodriguez had zero liability coverage on her car insurance policy, sources said, so Rivera's estate was able to collect $100,000 from her car insurance policy for an uninsured motorist claim.\n",

Shamosh said she suffered injuries to the lumbo-sacral spinal areas of her lower back, along with a bruised knee, bruised lower rib cage and soft tissue damage. She said she has marked soreness and pain in her lower back. Shamosh sued Hall in Monmouth County, N.J., Superior Court on May 21, 2003.\n",

      "###########\n",
      "Background: On Dec. 5, 1996, Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Co. issued a life insurance policy on David J. Feit of Wayne, N.J. On July 22, 2002, sources told Mealey Publications, Feit's car breached a guard rail on the New York State Thruway and went down a 670-foot grassy slope, where it bounced and hit a fence, killing Feit. Sources said that Feit, 44, was found clutching his chest and not wearing a seat belt and that the air bags on the car had not been deployed. Death was the result of a myocardial infarction, caused by a 50 percent blockage of the coronary arteries.At the time of Feit's death, there were death benefits on the policy of $1 million and additional accidental death benefits of $1 million. As of July 22, 2002, Feit's widow, Frani Feit, was entitled to 80 percent of the proceeds of the policy and Irwin J. Feit was entitled to 20 percent.Frani Feit originally sued Great-West in the Passaic County Superior Court on May 22, 2003, and the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey on June 20, 2003.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: The trial lasted nine days, and the jury deliberated eight hours, sources said.The jury found that the car crash, not a pre-existing condition, caused Feit's death in the auto accident, making his estate eligible for the $1 million accidental death policy.Sources said the insurance company agreed to pay the basic $1 million policy but refused to pay the $1 million for accidental death because Feit died of natural causes.The judge awarded an additional $188,931.50 in prejudgment interest to the jury verdict on Nov. 15, 2006.On Nov. 1, 2004, Great-West moved for summary judgment and the motion was partially granted Oct. 18, 2005.Great-West moved for a new trial on Nov. 29, 2006.\n",

      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that on Jan. 2, 2003, at about 8 a.m., Geta Pramdip was driving her car in the eastbound lanes of Roosevelt Avenue in Carteret, N.J., when she stopped behind a bus. That's when Pramdip was rear-ended by a car driven by Donald Dekolf, sources said.Sources said Dekolf contended that the sun was glaring in his eyes and he couldn't see her. The police noted this in the police report, sources said.Pramdip contended that she suffered neck, back and left arm injuries, sources said. Sources said she argued this at trial with proof of three MRIs and six EMG tests, which showed disc herniations at C5-6. Pramdip was treated for the injury, including physical therapy, epidural injections in her neck and pain medication, sources said.Sources said the defense argued that Pramdip's injuries were pre-existing and did not meet the state's verbal threshold statute.Pramdip sued Dekolf on June 18, 2003, in the Middlesex County Superior Court.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: Sources said the trial lasted four days and the jury deliberated 30 minutes.Pramdip's medical expenses were covered by her insurance, and she sued for pain and suffering, sources said.A motion for a new trial was filed Sept. 22, 2006, and was denied at that time, sources said.\n",

Three days after the accident, sources said, Hensler had open reduction and fixation surgery for a displaced tibial plateau fracture of the right knee. She had screws and a plate inserted in the knee to stabilize it, sources said. Hensler also suffered minor damage to the meniscus ligament and other ligaments in her knee, sources said.The accident caused Hensler to spend eight days in the hospital and to be confined to a rehabilitation hospital for three months, sources said.Hensler sued Ebinger on Jan. 23, 2006, in the Bergen County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",

      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that this settlement arises from the consolidation of three cases stemming from the same accident on March 17, 2004. Shortly after midnight, sources said, George Kukla lost control of his car on the partially snow-covered lanes of Interstate 287 north near Newark International Airport. Sources said Kukla's wife, Helena J. Kukla, was in the passenger seat and Hana Marsik and Emily Paroulek were in the rear seats. As the car fishtailed, sources said, a tractor-trailer heading north on Route 287 failed to take evasive action and hit the car.Sources said the tractor-trailer was owned by Pablo J. Asson, doing business as Argentina Trucking, and was pulling a trailer owned by E&P Logistics. The trailer was operated by a driver using the fictitious name Miguel Martinez, sources said.Paroulek died at the scene, sources said, and Marsik needed immediate surgery to insert a chest tube for a collapsed right lung. Sources said she also sustained multiple rib fractures, a right scapula fracture, a fractured right shoulder and multiple spine fractures. Later, sources said, she was diagnosed with adjustment disorder and sought psychiatric treatment. Helena Kukla was admitted to the hospital with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, a right third nerve palsy and concussion resulting in post-traumatic amnesia and cognitive deficits, sources said.The three lawsuits that comprised this case were filed in the Morris County, N.J., Superior Court on Aug. 10, 2003.\n",

Asson, d/b/a Argentina Trucking and E&P Logistics Inc.; and Tomas Korensky and Margaret Korensky Pages as executors of the Estate of Emily Paroulek, deceased, v.

      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that on Oct. 28, 2001, Harriet Speed, a teacher in her 50s, was driving on Van Skyer Parkway, a two-lane road, near Country Club Drive in Willingboro, N.J., when her car collided head-on at a curve with a car driven in the opposite direction by St. Elmo Belgrave.Sources said Speed claimed that Belgrave was speeding in his Porsche and crossed the center line into her lane when rounding the bend. Sources said Speed claimed that she had to cross into Belgrave's lane because there was no shoulder, causing Belgrave to swerve again. Sources said Belgrave claimed that he was not speeding and never left his own lane. As a result of the accident, Speed suffered a fractured pinky on her right hand and underwent two surgeries, which included the placement of a pin in her finger. She now suffers from arthritis in her hand, sources said. Speed sued Belgrave on Oct. 6, 2003, in the Burlington County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: The jury awarded Speed $43,500 but also found her to be 45 percent at fault, so the award was reduced to $23,925, sources said. Belgrave, sources said, was found to be 55 percent liable for the accident.Sources said the trial lasted two days and the jury deliberated for two hours.\n",

      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that on Feb. 8, 2002, Jeffrey Howard Sr. and his son Jeffrey Howard Jr. were driving on Washington Road in Sayreville, N.J., when they were involved in a chain-reaction auto accident.The Howards were struck in the rear by a car driven by Michael A. Falzone, who had just been rear-ended by a car driven by Lorraine Gerlesky and owned by John Gerlesky, sources said.Sources said both of the Howards sustained serious injuries. Howard Sr. suffered a bulging disc at C5-C6, focal disc herniation with adjacent spondylitic change at C6-C7 and bilateral carpel tunnel syndrome with bilateral C6-C7 radiculopathy, sources said. Meanwhile, sources said Howard Jr. suffered a bulging disc at C4-C5 and straightening of the normal cervical curve consistent with muscular spasm and bulging of the posterior annular fibers at the L5-S1 level of the lumbar spine. At the time of the accident, Howard Jr. was 15 years old and very active in athletics, sources said, but as a result of the injuries from the accident, could no longer participate in any of them. He continues to have pain in his lower back, sources said.The Howards sued Falzone and the Gerleskys on Jan. 30, 2004, in the Middlesex County Superior Court.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: The trial lasted two days, and the jury deliberated 2-1/2 hours, sources said, and found that both plaintiffs suffered permanent injuries because of the accident. Sources said Falzone was released from the case because he did not cause the accident because his car was pushed into the Howard's vehicle by Lorraine Gerlesky striking his car.Gerlesky's insurance carrier was New Jersey Manufacturer's Insurance Co., sources said.\n",

      "Background: Jesenia Jimenez, a pedestrian, was struck by a car. The car stopped only momentarily, allowing Jimenez to catch a glimpse of the driver, but did not stop. Jimenez got up and walked to her bus stop, where she caught a bus and went to work. Because Jimenez was complaining of pain, her employer took her to the hospital, where emergency room physicians treated her with ice packs and analgesics and released her. She brought a personal injury action in the Essex County, N.J., Superior Court, Law Division, seeking to recover damages for her injuries. Jimenez named the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund as a defendant.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: After it was established that neither William Baglieri nor his car were involved in the accident, summary judgment was granted in favor of Baglieri and Material Damage Adjustment Corp. The jury found that the unidentified hit-and-run driver was 100 percent negligent. The jury returned a verdict of $25,000 in favor of Jimenez. A judgment was entered against the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund for $15,000 and subsequently an amended judgment was entered, which also required the fund to pay personal injury protection benefits to Jimenez. The judgment requiring the fund to pay personal injury protection benefits was reversed and remanded for a new trial because Jimenez s claim was not subject to the verbal threshold for injuries caused from an unidentified driver. The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case, determining that Jimenez was required to meet a verbal threshold in regard to her noneconomic losses to be eligible for the claimed funds.\n",

Scardino suffered shearing hemorrhages to the brain, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhages with diffuse axonal injury to the brain, left trigeminal neuropathy, closed-head trauma with post-concussive syndrome and a right, fourth nerve palsy.

Gravenstine was sent into Kozarski's vehicle after being rear-ended by a car driven by Winisius Silva and owned by Carlius Alves. The impact of the crash forced Kozarski's car into a vehicle driven by Diane Pestridge and caused Kozarski's face to strike the steering wheel and knock loose the permanent bridge in his mouth, sources said. Sources said Kozarski also suffered a spine injury requiring surgery, a left shoulder injury, herniated discs, bulging discs, erectile dysfunction, rotator cuff injury, post concussion syndrome and spine and lumbar sprains. As a result of the crash, Kozarski sued Gravenstine, Oksana Shapowlenko, Silva and Alves in 2003 in the Burlington County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",

Zizza's car sideswiped Gangemi's, causing it to flip over, sources said. As a result of the collision, Gangemi, who was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown backward in the car and suffered herniated discs at L4-L5 and L5-S1, which required a laminectomy and then disc replacement surgery, sources said.Zizza contended that Gangemi caused the accident because he was speeding around the corner and around a car that was attempting to make a right turn and thus came right across Zizza's path, resulting in the accident, sources said.Sources said Zizza was using his own car to make a delivery for his employer, Mr. Pool Supply Inc., and he was ticketed for careless driving and going through a stop sign,Gangemi sued Zizza and Mr. Pool on April 11, 2005, in the Middlesex County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",

      "Background: Kimberly Valentini suffered from serious injuries after she was involved in a car accident. Valentini was driving a 1987 Ford Bronco II at the time of the accident. Valentini has incurred more than $1.5 million in medical expenses.The case went to trial against Ford Motor Co. before the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: A jury awarded Valentini more than $20.5 million in damages on Dec. 23, 2005. The breakdown of the award is as follows: $1,513,327 for past medical and rehabilitation expenses; $13 million for future medical expenses; $300,000 for lost income; $700,000 for future lost income; $5 million for pain and suffering.The jury answered yes to the following questions: the Ford Bronco contained a design defect; the defect was the proximate cause of the alleged damages; Ford provided inadequate warning of the specific rollover hazard presented by the Ford Bronco; and the inadequate warning constituted a proximate cause of Valentini.Sources said the jury deliberated for approximately seven hours. Sources said the trial lasted five days. An appeal is not expected, the sources added.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Defense: Sources told Mealey Publications that the defense argued that the vehicle did not contain design defects, that the company provided adequate warnings and that the actual damages were less than the damages sought by Valentini.\n",

      "Claim: Bad faith, punitive damages\n",

      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that this case stems from a case that was settled in 2004.On April 26, 2000, sources said, Kathleen Greene stopped her car at a traffic signal at Route 130 north and Haines Mill Road in Delran, N.J. Sources said Greene was rear-ended by a car driven by Michael J. Pustie, who claimed that a phantom vehicle cut him off. Greene was injured and could no longer work as a medical biller, sources said.Sources said Pustie's insurance carrier, State Farm Indemnity Co., paid $295,768.84 in 2004 to exhaust its $300,000 combined single-limit policy (with just over $4,000 being used to pay property damages).Sources said State Farm then appealed an uninsured motorist arbitration panel award of $451,500 in damages, citing a need to apportion liability and rejecting the damages as too high. Sources said Burlington County Court Judge John Harrington held the arbitration award as binding as to liability, reserved on the credit and ordered a trial on damages.Greene and her husband, Gerard Greene, sued State Farm for the panel's award on Feb. 17, 2005, in the Burlington County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",

The front right end of Worden's car struck the front left end of Burzynski's car.Worden claimed that he slowly entered Washington Avenue and stopped to look both ways before the cars collided, sources said. Burzynski failed to notice Worden's vehicle because she was coming around the corner less than 500 feet from the point of the accident, he argued.Burzynski claimed to have suffered bulging discs at L3-4, L5-S1, C3-4 and C4-5 and underwent chiropractic treatment for about a 18 months, sources said.

      "Background: Leon Shnayder says his car was rear-ended by Lori McGrail's car on July 19, 2001, after he had pulled onto the shoulder of the road because he'd missed his exit. McGrail and police reports say that when McGrail moved from the right lane to the center lane she struck Shnayder, and he then moved to the side of the road. Shnayder was taken to a hospital and diagnosed with a concussion and a cut on the bridge of his nose. CT scans and X-rays were taken, and the results showed injuries not attributable to the accident. Four months later, arthroscopic surgery was performed on Shnayder's right shoulder. An independent examination of Shnayder's shoulder concluded that a rear-end collision was an unlikely cause of the injury and that none of the injuries were permanent, as Shnayder claimed.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: The jury found that McGrail was negligent in operation of her vehicle and that her negligence was an approximate cause of the accident. The jury also found that Shnayder was negligent in operation of his vehicle and that his negligence was an approximate cause of the accident. In the final jury question, Shnayder was found 90 percent negligent and McGrail 10 percent.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Defense: Allegations denied.  McGrail admits rear-ending Shnayder's vehicle but contends that it happened in the center lane of traffic, not on the shoulder.\n",

      "Claim: Products liability\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Background: Lloyd Wallace, on behalf of his deceased 22-year-old daughter, filed a wrongful death products liability action in the Middlesex County, N.J., Superior Court, Law Division, against Ford Motor Co., which manufactured the decedent s car, and Conti-Causeway Ford & Lincoln Mercury, which sold this new car to the decedent in April 1989. Wallace s cause of action was predicated on the fact that at some point in the accident, the right rear axle snapped and the right rear wheel disconnected from the decedent s car. Wallace alleged a manufacturing defect in the right rear axle, which caused a wobble in the right rear wheel, which eventually led to the shear-fracture found in the right rear axle after the accident. Wallace asserted that this axle snapped and that this caused the decedent to lose control of her car. Ford and Conti-Causeway maintained that the decedent lost control of her car at the curve because she was drunk, (.168 blood alcohol content) and speeding at 70 mph in a 50-mph zone. Rather than causing the roll-over accident, the defendants asserted that the right rear axle fractured after the accident began, when the car, which became airborne several times, landed on its right rear wheel during one of the rollovers. The force of this impact with the pavement fractured the right rear axle, disconnecting the right rear wheel.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: The jury found that the right rear axle in the decedent s car was not defective while under the control of Ford and Conti-Causeway. Based on the jury verdict, the trial court entered a judgment of no cause of action in favor of Ford and Conti-Causeway. The trial court denied Wallace s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, new trial or mistrial. The judgment was affirmed on appeal.\n",

On impact, the front bumper of the car drove DiMaria s left foot into the cover, which shattered. DiMaria s heel was forced against the exposed rotating chain and clutch plate and both the skin and muscle surrounding his left heel were torn down to the bone. DiMaria sued the driver of the car and Harley Davidson in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Bergen County. Against Harley, DiMaria claimed that a defect in the front chain housing cover aggravated his injuries. He alleged that the housing cover had been defectively designed and defectively manufactured. The other driver settled with DiMaria for his policy limits.\n",

Sources said that as a result of the accident, Pisciotta struck his head on the steering wheel and suffered a herniation of the L5-S1. Pisciotta underwent nine months of chiropractic treatment, sources said.Then on July 16, 2002, sources said Pisciotta's car was nearly struck by a vehicle driven by Rajesh Patel, as it attempted left turn into a gas station on Stilton Road in Woodbridge. Sources said Pisciotta hit the brakes and just touched Patel's car. The sudden stopping, sources said, caused a re-aggravation of the injuries suffered in the Vargas accident.Pisciotta sued Patel and Vargas on Jan. 9, 2004, in the Middlesex County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: Sources said the trial lasted five days, and the jury deliberated two hours and 40 minutes.Sources said that both defendants were found 100 percent liable for the accidents but that because Vargas caused the first accident and found to be the sole contributor to Pisciotta's injuries, he is responsible for payment of the $150,000 jury verdict.\n",

Henderson and owned by Villari Brothers Trucking Inc. was following right behind and collided with Purce's car. Purce and her mother, Melinda K. Layton, a passenger in the vehicle, suffered severe, multiple and permanent injuries. Layton's injuries included a torn ligament in her knee, and Purce sustained soft-tissue damage to her wrist. Layton and Truce initially filed suit in the Monmouth County, N.J., Superior Court on July 30, 2004.

Henderson and Villari Brothers moved for entry of default on Sept. 29, 2004, and the motion was denied Oct. 25, 2004. Purce moved for summary judgment on June 16, 2005, and the motion was denied Sept. 22, 2005.\n",

      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that on May 3, 2005, Michele T. Cooney was driving home from work on South Egg Harbor Road in Winslow Township, N.J., when a car driven by Frank J. Gramaglia failed to yield at a stop sign on Fleming Pike. The impact of the crash caused Cooney's car to be t-boned on the driver's side, and it caused Cooney's car to slide into a utility pole, crushing the passenger side of her car, sources said.Sources said Cooney suffered a ruptured spleen, acetabular and pubic ramus fractures, tibial plateau fractures, renal artery injury, pulmonary contusions, multiple rib fractures and abdominal compartment syndrome. Cooney spent the first three months after the accident in a drug-induced coma while her injuries healed, sources said. Upon discharge from the hospital, sources said Cooney spent the next two months at a rehabilitation hospital and then another four months at a convalescent and nursing center. Eventually, sources said, Cooney had to sell her two-story townhouse because it was not handicapped accessible, and she moved in with her mother, who made her home handicapped accessible. Cooney was rendered totally and permanently disabled and did not return to her job as an X-ray technician at Kessler Hospital, sources said.Cooney sued Gramaglia on Sept. 9, 2005, in the Camden County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: The trial lasted four days, and the jury deliberated for about three hours, sources said.Sources said Gramaglia hired personal counsel Eric A. Browndorf because his auto liability carrier, New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance, had tendered its $100,000 policy even before the suit was filed. Cooney also learned before filing suit that Gramaglia was attempting to hide his assets by transferring ownership of his vacation home to his wife and that he owned multiple properties and business interests, sources said.\n",

Sources said the plaintiff claimed that the defendant never stopped at the stop sign. Gomez claimed that when she started to make a left turn, Al-Jalodi, who she said was speeding, collided with her. Al-Jalodi claimed to suffer injuries including herniated disk, bulging disk, left ankle injury, inflammation of the left shoulder, pain, stiffness, reduced range of motion and strength in the cervical and lumbar spines and left shoulder. Al-Jalodi sued Gomez in the Hudson County, N.J., Superior Court on Dec. 23, 2003.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: According the sources, the jury found Gomez negligent in operation of her vehicle and found that negligence was a proximate cause of any injuries suffered by Al-Jalodi. Al-Jalodi was found negligent in the operation of his vehicle, and the jury found that his negligence was a proximate cause of any injuries he suffered. The jury also found Al-Jalodi 80 percent negligent and Gomez 20 percent negligent in causing the accident. The jury agreed that Al-Jalodi suffered a permanent injury proximately caused by the automobile accident. Al-Jalodi was awarded damages of $1,000 for pain suffering and loss of enjoyment of life, but the damages were withheld due to liability allocation. Instead, Al-Jalodi was awarded $2,500 for damages to his car.\n",

      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that between 2000 and 2004, employees of the New Jersey Re-Insurance Co., a division of the New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Co., began noticing a trend occurring concerning a string of reported accidents, primarily in Essex County, N.J.The claims followed a particular pattern of obtaining minimal coverage for an older vehicle and then within weeks reporting accidents with little or no damage to the cars, but allegedly causing injuries requiring chiropractic treatment and diagnostic tests for multiple passengers in each car, sources said.Sources said that after the accidents, policyholders typically let insurance coverage lapse by stopping premium payments. The same cars were then often involved in multiple accidents, sources said, passing from owner to owner among the 42 named in the complaint. Sources said the drivers and passengers involved frequently shared the same current or prior addresses.New Jersey Re-Insurance sued Wilkens Vincent and the numerous other members of the accident staging ring on Aug. 10, 2005, in the Mercer County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",

      "Claim: Negligence, carelessness and recklessness\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that Paul Dolan was driving on Route 46 in Palisades Park, N.J., on Jan. 2, 2004, when a Sea Transfer Corp. tractor-trailer, which was traveling in the other direction, swerved and lost its load of containers. One of the 20,000-pound containers and chassis landed on Dolan s car, sources said. Dolan alleged that the container was secured with two pins and not the required four pins, according to sources. As a result of the accident, sources said, Dolan s hips, legs and right foot were crushed and his right leg is two inches shorter than his left. He also suffered emotional wounds from the trauma of the accident, sources said.Dolan sued Hapag-Lloyd America Corp., which owned the container and chassis, shipping terminal owner Howland Hook Marine Terminal, Sea Transfer and truck driver Jose Gonzalez on Dec. 1, 2004, in the Middlesex County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: The jury verdict was announced Aug. 11, 2006. The trial was held to determine damages. According to sources, in September 2005, the court granted the plaintiff s summary judgment against Howland, truck driver Jose Gonzalez and Sea Transfer, finding them liable for the charges. Sources said Judge Matthias Rodriguez applied New York state law to the case because the container was loaded onto the truck at the Howland terminal on Staten Island, N.Y. New York law explains that the container s owner is liable without fault for the truck driver s actions. Kathy Dolan is Paul Dolan s wife.Sources said Howland, Sea Transfer and Gonzalez were not part of the trial and reached undisclosed settlements with the plaintiffs before trial. As determined by the Court, Hapag-Lloyd was not responsible for causing this accident, Hapag-Lloyd said in a statement. The court already determined the truck driver caused this accident when he failed to properly lock the container to the chassis. Hapag-Lloyd did not hire the truck driver or the company that employed him, and played no role in his training. The trial as to Hapag-Lloyd proceeded solely because the Court applied New York law, which provides that the owner of a shipping container is liable without fault for the truck driver s actions. This is particularly unfair in this case where the container and chassis were safe and without defects. Hapag-Lloyd also said it will appeal the decision.\n",

Houde then looked in his rear-view mirror and saw a car driven by Donald Applegate coming toward him and not slowing down, sources said. Sources said Houde tried to pull over to the side of the road but couldn't do so in time and Applegate struck Houde and the car in front of him.Sources said Houde suffered a herniated disc. An MRI showed the herniation, sources said, but a myelogram did not. Sources said Houde was forced to give up his hair styling business because of arm and shoulder pain and not being able to lift or sit for long stretches of time. Houde is now a salesman, sources said. Sources said the defense argued that Houde had a pre-existing spinal condition.Houde sued Applegate on Dec. 7, 2004, in the Atlantic County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",

      "Other: Sources said that the first claim in this case was initially filed Aug. 6, 1998, and that the case lay dormant for six years while Applegate served in the U.S. Air Force. Houde, sources said, agreed to a waiver in 1998 surrendering the statute of limitations of two years for the case in exchange for being able to refile his complaint when Applegate was discharged from the military.Applegate agreed to admit to liability in return for Houde not collecting any settlement above Applegate's $100,000 Allstate policy limit, sources said.\n",

      "Background: On March 11, 2004, Naseer Iqbal was driving along Interstate 76 in Mechanicsburg, Pa., when, sources told Mealey Publications, he lost control of his truck after the left rear wheel separated and caused the truck to go off the road. Sources said Iqbal was trapped in the truck and burned to death. The accident came four hours after the car had been serviced at a New Brunswick, N.J., automobile service center, sources said. The service center did not properly mount the wheel, which caused the lug nuts to loosen and the wheel to dislodge from the axel, sources said. Rasheeda Iqbal is the wife of Naseer Iqbal; she, on behalf her husband, filed suit in the Middlesex County, N.J., Superior Court, on April 23, 2004.\n",

Sources said Angelo sued New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance, his insurance company, after it denied coverage, claiming that Angelo was also at fault because he allegedly sped up to go through a yellow traffic light at the intersection.Sources said the defendant was pondering whether to file an appeal because NJM felt the jury award should have been capped at the policy limit of $300,000.As a result of the accident, sources said, Angelo no longer works as a regional salesman for a company that sells remanufactured engines and now sells chemicals to auto dealerships.\n",

      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that on Sept. 6, 2001, Richard \"Doug\" Cannon's restored 1984 Mustang hatchback stalled in the center southbound lane of Route 1 near the top of an overpass in Avenel, N.J. Though sources said the stationary Mustang was visible more than 1,900 feet away, Gerard M. Taber, the driver of a 13,500 flatbed tow truck owned by E&D Auto Repair, a/k/a E&D Repair, rear-ended the Mustang at about 57 mph as he looked at a mobile data terminal inside his truck while en route to another accident.Sources said the impact crushed the Mustang's fuel tank between the tow truck's stiff front end and two rigid aftermarket steel pipes Cannon had welded to the undercarriage of the car to stiffen the Mustang's frame.At impact, sources said Cannon, then 21, was ejected from the Mustang and onto a trail of burning gasoline. Sources said he suffered third-degree burns from his waist up, which included 59 percent of his full body surface. The accident left Cannon with extensive facial disfigurement, partial blindness, the complete loss of use of his left hand and other serious injuries for which he still receives extensive treatment, sources said. Since the accident, sources said Cannon has spent about 50 weeks in the hospital.Sources said Ford Motor Co. was sued by Cannon when AAA-Mid-Atlantic Inc. asserted a claim against it, alleging that the 1984 Mustang's aft-of-axle fuel tank was uncrashworthy in rear impact accidents.Cannon sued Ford, AAA MidAtlantic, E&D Auto Repair, a/k/a E&D Repair, Gerard M. Taber, Mentor-Campana Systems, the maker and distributor of the mobile data terminal found in the truck, on Jan. 11, 2002, in the Middlesex County Superior Court.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: Ford's trial lasted seven weeks, sources said, and the judge found precluded the testimony of an expert witness for AAA MidAtlantic.Sources said AAA Central-West Jersey filed a third-party complaint against Harleysville Insurance Co. and Ford.On June 8, sources said Cannon settled before closing arguments in the trial with AAA MidAtlantic, E&D Auto Repair, a/k/a E&D Repair, Gerard M. Taber, Mentor-Campana Systems for $31,250,000 on a pain and suffering claim. Sources said that after deliberating four days, the jury found E&D/Taber 85 percent liable for the accident, with AAA MidAtlantic 14 percent liable and Cannon 1 percent liable.Sources said the settlement of $2 million each with E&D/Taber and Mentor-Campana was for the policy limit of each.An emergency petition filed by AAA-Mid-Atlantic to stay the trial for an interlocutory appeal was rejected by the Superior Court Appellate Division, sources said.\n",

Harbison, who was driving south, claimed that he lost control of his vehicle when he swerved left to avoid a car stopped in front of him.Sources said Schafer, who was wearing a seat belt, suffered a collapsed lung, left hip fracture, concussion and fractured ribs. Schafer's spleen was removed and an infection that developed into gangrene required removal of 90 percent of his intestines, sources said. Schafer also suffers from incontinence, sources said, walks with a limp, has pins in his hip and suffers from abdominal problems. Schafer remained in the hospital from the time of the accident until the end of November 2005.As a result of the accident, sources said, Schafer was forced to give up his job as a machine operator at Sambol Construction Co., where he worked for 44 years.There were two dogs in the car with Schafer, sources said, and one died in the accident.Schafer sued Harbison on March 22, 2006, in the Bergen County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",

      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that on June 24, 1999, Ronye Leder, of East Windsor, was injured in a multivehicle accident on Route 130 in South Brunswick, N.J. Leder was injured when her car was cut off by an unidentified sport utility vehicle as Leder approached the scene of an accident and hit the rear wheel of the truck driven and was sitting on the shoulder of the road, sources said. Leder's car ricocheted across traffic, where it was struck by a car driven by Ammie Cruz, sources said. Sources said Anthony Fresca, driving a truck owned by Pomponio Trucking, had hit a van driven by Kumi Sarpong and owned by Jackson Trucking while making an illegal U-turn and causing the chain-reaction accident.Sources said Leder suffered a fractured right hip and later had her right knee replaced. Both have caused her to walk with a limp, sources said. Leder also fractured her left thumb and had minor dental problems along with facial lacerations, sources said. Leder sued Sarpong, Cruz, Fresca, Pomponio Trucking and Jackson Trucking on Jan. 23, 2001, in the Mercer County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: Sources said the jury deliberated for about an hour and found Cruz not liable. Sources said Leder settled with Fresca and Pomponio during the trial.Sources said Leder settled with Fresca and Pomponio for $300,000 and with Sarpong and Jackson Trucking for $45,000. Leder also received the policy limit of $100,000 for uninsured motorist coverage involving the unidentified SUV, sources said. The plaintiff moved for a new trial on Sept. 29, 2006, on the basis of continuing liability against those involved in the accident, sources said.Sources said the trial ran Sept. 13 to 20.\n",

      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that on April 30, 2002, Sara Petronis was driving north on the Garden State Parkway just before the Marmora Bridge. As Petronis passed the Somers Point Toll Plaza, Petronis said she accelerated to 75 mph in the far left lane, sources said. At that point, sources said a pickup truck driven by Roger Venorder appeared right behind Petronis and began tailgating her. Sources said Petronis said she tapped on her brakes as a warning to Venorder to back off, but he then cut in and out of traffic to the right to race ahead. When Venorder appeared in front of Petronis, sources said, he then slammed on his brakes, which caused Petronis to swerve, lose control of her car and go off the highway.Sources said Venorder left the scene immediately but did report the accident to state police about 20 minutes later.Venorder, sources said, claimed that as he was driving behind Petronis, he wished to pass her so he flashed his lights several times and when she ignored this, he passed her on the right. Sources said Venorder claimed that when he did this, Petronis sped up alongside him, preventing him from passing. When he finally passed Petronis, Venorder claimed that she began tailgating him and flashed him the middle finger, sources said. When Venorder tapped on his brakes to ask Petronis to back off, sources said she then moved her car to the right.As a result of the accident, Petronis suffered a bulging lumbar disc, sources said. She visited a chiropractor 75 times and still experiences pain, sources said. Sources said Petronis was a deli clerk and she was forced to miss about three months of work. At the time of the accident, sources said, Petronis was pregnant and she has since delivered a healthy baby.Petronis sued Venorder on April 16, 2004, in the Atlantic County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: Sources said Venorder made no offer of settlement before or during the trial.The trial lasted two days, and the jury deliberated two hours, sources said.Sources said the jury found Petronis 25 percent comparatively negligent for the accident and as a result reduced the actual award to $48,600. The two sides reached a confidential settlement after the trial, sources said, in exchange for Venorder waiving his right to make further post-trial motions.\n",

      "Claim: Underinsured motorist claim\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that on Nov. 20, 2001, Stanley Majocha was driving a commercial van on U.S. Route 27 near the intersection with New Dover Road in Colonia, N.J., when he was rear-ended by a car that was out of control; the impact caused Majocha's car to flip over.Sources said Majocha claimed that he suffered herniated discs at L4-5 and L5-S1. Sources said for the first two years after the accident, Majocha had few back problems because of the accident. However, in 2003 sources said Majocha resumed treatment with a chiropractor and pain management doctor.The injuries also caused Majocha to give up his lucrative cabinet-making business because he could no longer lift wood or make deliveries, sources said. Before the accident, Majocha claimed that he made more than $500,000 a year, but after the accident, his income fell to about $12,000.Sources said there was no dispute on liability because the underlying claim was settled for $15,000 with the other driver's insurance company, Prudential. Instead, sources said Majocha filed an underinsured motorist claim with his own carrier, New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Co. (NJM), and the insurance carrier for the commercial van, Selective Insurance Group Inc. Sources said both carriers rejected Majocha's claims.Majocha sued NJM and Selective Insurance on Sept. 2, 2005, in the Union County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: Of the settlement, Selective Insurance paid $200,000 and NJM contributed $50,000, sources said.Sources said a nonbinding arbitration award of $330,000 was granted but rejected by NJM and Selective Insurance. NJM had demanded a trial de novo from the arbitration award and was able to save about $75,000 of its pro rata share of the settlement by taking the case to court, sources said.\n",

Carvalho. The collision caused Fernandez's car to careen off the road and strike a utility pole head-on. Among the injuries Fernandez suffered were partial disc desiccation in her spine, disc protrusion with nerve root compression, disc herniation, posterior capsulities, temporal tendonitis, stylomandibular ligament sprain, articular disc disorder and traumatic arthropathy. After the accident, Fernandez said, she suffered from headaches, neck pain, dizziness and lightheadedness, occasional difficulty opening her mouth, pain when yawning, grinding of teeth, shoulder pain, back pain and depression. Fernandez sued Carvalho in the Union County, N.J., Superior Court on Aug. 19, 2004.\n",

      "Claim: Negligence\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Background: Sources told Mealey Publications that in December 1996, Stephen Shankman and his wife, Dora, were returning to their home in Pennsylvania from a party in New Jersey when they were involved in an auto accident on Interstate 287 in a construction zone near Interstate 78 in Somerset County, N.J.Stephen Shankman was driving in the only lane available through the construction zone when the car rear-ended a backhoe that had been placed in the lane by an employee of Conti Enterprises of South Plainfield, N.J., which was handling the construction, sources said.Sources said Dora Shankman fractured her pelvis, right femur and tibia, right forearm, right foot and right clavicle. She walks with a limp and can't stand or walk for long periods. Sources said Stephen Shankman sustained a concussion, lacerated tongue, broken teeth, pulmonary swelling and fractures to his pelvis, sternum, right tibia, fibula and ulna.The Shankmans sued Conti Enterprises on Nov. 24, 1998, in the Somerset County, N.J., Superior Court.\n",
      "###########\n",
      "Other: Sources said Dora Shankman sued Stephen Shankman, claiming that he was driving too fast. That case settled for $400,000.This settlement came on the eve of a second trial in the case, sources said. The first trial took place from March to April 2002 and ended with a $1.64 million verdict that was set aside because of an error when plaintiff's attorney Kenneth Javerbaum asked for the jurors to be polled to find out whether they had improperly calculated the liability percentages, and Judge Rosemarie Williams refused, sources said. The New Jersey Superior Court Appellate Division found the refusal in error and ordered a new trial for both plaintiffs in fall 2004, sources said. Sources said the plaintiffs' use of animation to reconstruct the accident scene showed whether Stephen Shankman was driving too fast and if Conti Enterprises failed to let oncoming drivers know of the backhoe taking up the only lane in use.During the original trial, sources said, the jury found no cause of action for Stephen Shankman's complaint but found Conti 42 percent negligent and Stephen Shankman 58 percent negligent on Dora Shankman's complaint. The jury in the first trial assessed damages for her at $1.64 million - a recovery of $690,480 after negligence was factored in.\n",

Sources said Radom underwent partial hip replacement and shoulder surgery. She was in the hospital for two weeks, sources said, and in a rehabilitation hospital for one month.

Then Malick got up and went to his own car for additional parts, sources said, and he slipped and fell on a patch of soapy water and oil that had accumulated from a car being washed and detailed by ACR Mobile Detailing.Sources said Malick waited six days after the accident to seek medical treatment for a herniated disc at L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5 and didn't get his first treatment for the injury until Feb. 7, 2003. As a result of the accident, sources said, Malick is unable to return to work and is on permanent disability. Sources said that as a result of scar tissue and severe arthritis resulting from the accident, Malick is in severe pain and must take five medications a day, including a muscle relaxant and nerve-damage medication. Malick sued Seaview and ACR on May 10, 2004, in the Atlantic County Superior Court.\n",

Sources said that in the first trial the jury found no cause of action, but Judge Marie Simonelli granted Hedvat's request for a new trial based on the findings of a doctor who said she could have suffered temporary injury in the crash. In the second trial, sources said the jury awarded $15,000. Sources said Hedvat's lawyers appealed this verdict because the second trial was limited to damages only. Merwin filed a cross-appeal, claiming that a new trial shouldn't be granted; the New Jersey Appellate Division ordered a new trial, sources said.\n",

      "Other: Sources said the case was tried on liability only and the parties stipulated to damages. The jury found the plaintiff 50 percent liable and the defendants 50 percent liable, so the actual amount was $8,750, sources said.The jury deliberated for 30 minutes, and the trial lasted two days, sources said.Sources said Pietrus died of unrelated causes before the trial. The defense moved to admit a statement Pietrus made to an insurance carrier that he was obeying the speed limit and Harper's truck came out of nowhere, sources said. Sources said the plaintiff's attorney argued that it was hearsay and that Pietrus could not be cross-examined, but the judge allowed the jury to hear the statement.\n",

Knopf, Cohn Lifland Pearlman Herrmann & Knopf, Saddle River, N.J Defendant Counsel Janine Long, assistant chief, deputy attorney general, Office of the New Jersey Attorney General, Trenton Case Summary Claim:\\xa0Violation of the New Jersey Tort Claims Act Background:\\xa0Sources told Mealey Publications that on Jan. 21, 2004, Alexandra M. Lisowski of Passaic, N.J., was driving over a New Jersey Transit railroad crossing at Midland Avenue in Elmwood Park, N.J., when she heard a train approaching from the north. Realizing that she might not have enough time to cross, Lisowski backed up her car, but instead of backing over the crossing like she came, Lisowski backed into a trench at the end of the tracks and the car got stuck, sources said. Sources said Lisowski exited the car just as it was hit by the train, which also clipped her.Lisowski suffered a compression fracture at T-12 in her lower back, sources said, and had surgery to fuse five vertebrae together with a steel rod. Sources said Lisowski, now 33, has physical restrictions on bending and twisting her body.Lisowski sued New Jersey Transit on Nov. 3, 2004, in the Bergen County, N.J., Superior Court. Other:\\xa0The Borough of Elmwood Park, N.J., was initially named in the complaint, sources said, but was dismissed before trial.Sources said the trial lasted six days and the jury deliberated two hours.New Jersey Transit was found to be 51 percent negligent because the train was going too fast and broke too late to avoid hitting Lisowski's car, sources said. Lisowski was found 49 percent negligent because the jury said she should have waited for the cars in front of her to pass over the tracks before proceeding and because she would have backed up in a straight line, sources said. Sources said that as a result, the jury award was reduced to $765,000.Sources said New Jersey Transit made no offer of settlement before the trial and rejected a nonbinding arbitration award of $150,000. Defense:\\xa0Allegations denied; comparative negligence.
